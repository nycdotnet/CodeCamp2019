Intermediate	Marquis (18)	15:15 - 16:15	Luis Quintanilla	Introduction to Spark.NET	Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed, general-purpose analytics engine. For years, it has been a staple in the Big Data ecosystem for batch and real-time processing on large datasets. Sparks provides a rich set of APIs that are optimized to overcome the limitations of other distributed programming models like MapReduce. Although native support for the platform is limited to the JVM set of languages, other languages typically used for data processing and analytics like Python and R have plugged into Spark's Interop layer to make use of its functionality. Around the time of the Build 2019 conference, Microsoft announced Spark.NET. Spark.NET provides bindings written for the Spark Interop layer that allow you to work with components like Spark SQL and Spark Streaming inside your .NET applications. Because Spark.NET is .NET Standard 2.0 compliant, it can run operating systems like Windows and Linux. In this session, you'll learn about Spark, its main components for processing large datasets and how to get started integrating Spark into your .NET applications with the help of Spark.NET.

Introductory and overview	Music Box (46)	09:15 - 10:15	Jim Wooley	Getting pushy with SignalR and Reactive Extensions	As our systems increasingly demand more real-time updates, we need better ways of working with these live streams of information. Traditional pull models fail to provide the real-time responsiveness and scale needs that modern systems expect. Moving to a push model allows us to scale easier and react to new data as it becomes available. SignalR facilitates push notifications over HTTP to a variety of clients. The Reactive Extensions were designed to allow for asynchronous LINQ over push based collections. In this talk, you’ll see how the synergy of these two technologies merge to make otherwise difficult tasks, a push over.

Introductory and overview	Central Park West (201)	15:15 - 16:15	Mofizur Rahman	Managing Kubernetes with Istio	Developers are moving away from large monolithic apps in favor of small, focused microservices that speed up implementation and improve resiliency. Microservices and containers changed application design and deployment patterns, but along with them brought challenges like service discovery, routing, failure handling, security and visibility to microservices.

“Service mesh” architecture was born to handle these features. Applications are getting decoupled internally as microservices, and the responsibility of maintaining coupling between these microservices is passed to the service mesh.Istio, a joint collaboration between IBM, Google and Lyft provides an easy way to create a service mesh that will manage many of these complex tasks automatically, without the need to modify the microservices themselves.

In this talk we will see how istio can be used to manage traffic, gather metrics and enforce policies in a demo application running microservices. We will learn why kubernetes need “service mesh” and how does Istio improve managing Kubernetes workload.

Introductory and overview	Central Park West (201)	09:15 - 10:15	Mark Rendle	How To Get Ahead In .NET	In 2020, Microsoft will release .NET 5. That's the name for the next version of .NET Core, and represents a single .NET for the future, encompassing Core, Mono, Xamarin, WebAssembly, Unity and more. .NET 4.x will be supported for years to come, but future development and features will be on the new, unified .NET platform.

For those of us with large codebases on .NET Framework 4.x, this means we have a choice: continue to run on the old .NET and miss out on all the new features, capabilities and performance improvements, or migrate all of that code to .NET 5. That's a big ask, but it may not be as daunting as it sounds.

In this talk, I'll look at .NET 4.x frameworks and components that are not being migrated to .NET Core, such as WCF and WebForms, and discuss the modern alternatives like gRPC, Web APIs and Blazor. I'll also show you strategies for migrating code a little at a time so you don't have to stop the world for an all-in-one rewrite. Whether you've got 10,000 lines of .NET Framework code or 10,000,000, I hope this talk will show you that the way forward to .NET 5 and beyond is realistic and accessible for everyone.	Intermediate	Central Park East (81)	10:30 - 11:30	Christina Low	Accessibility in Tech & Twitter A11y: A Browser Extension to Describe Images	In my experience over the summer in my Human Computer Interaction REU program at Carnegie Mellon University, I learned a lot regarding the intersection between psychology and computer science, specifically in regards to how as technology is advancing, the need for making software accessible is often overlooked and increasingly needed.

In this session, I will present and discuss the project I collaborated to make: Twitter A11y: A Browser Extension to Describe Images. 

Below is the abstract from our poster:
"Twitter is integral to many people’s lives for news, entertainment, and communication.  While people increasingly post images to Twitter, a large majority of images remain inaccessible to people with vision impairments due to a lack of image descriptions (i.e. alternative text). We present Twitter A11y (pronounced ally), a browser extension to make images accessible through a set of strategies tailored to the platform. For example, screenshots of text that exceed the Twitter character limit are common, so we detect textual images, and automatically add alternative text using optical character recognition.Tweet images apart from screenshots and link previews receive descriptions from crowd workers. Based on an evaluation of the timelines of 50 self-identified blind Twitter users, Twitter A11y increases automatic alt text coverage from 2.6% to 25.6%, before crowdsourcing the remaining images."	Introductory and overview	New Amsterdam (18)	15:15 - 16:15	Jared Rhodes	Build accessible apps with Cognitive Services	In this presentation, we will look over how cognition can create easier to use and more accessible applications.

Intermediate	Majestic (18)	09:15 - 10:15	Bob Crowley	Keeping Configuration Secrets Out Of Source Code	Keeping secrets safe and out of source code has always been challenging. De-coupling sensitive information like connection strings, certificates and passwords keeps these secrets out of source control where it is all to easy to expose them unintentionally.
This session focuses mostly on .Net Core Configuration and also provides an overview of how to leverage Azure App Service Settings, KeyVault and Managed Identities for Azure Resources to help alleviate this long-standing problem. Additionally we will see how to consume configuration even when you, the developer, don't have access to production secrets.
Demonstrated are three application scenarios - A non-Azure-hosted app, An Azure-hosted app and local debugging.
Time permitting, we will also see some techniques for managing secrets in full-framework applications that typically rely on web.config files.
This presentation gives you the basic knowledge to keep secrets out of source code while still assuring correct production configuration.

Gershwin (14)	10:30 - 11:30	Quintessence Anx	Unquantified Serendipity: Diversity in Development	Learning how to write software, architect infrastructure, and automate deployments is cognitively taxing. So much so, we probably spend a great deal of energy learning how to learn, learning how to retain, learning how to apply, learning how to be efficient, that learning how to be with each other gets lost in the mess.

Straight to the point: Computer programmer. Software developer. Production Engineer. When you read these terms, a picture probably starts to form in your mind’s eye - a sort of default for what a person behind these titles looks like. Maybe also how they sound - what language do you expect them to speak? How do they speak it?

Most likely, when you read those titles, you visualize a white male. He speaks English fluently with a local accent. If you pull up the photo behind an anonymized résumé, you might be surprised to find a Muslim woman wearing a hijab. Or perhaps you see someone who doesn’t speak fluent English, speaking instead with their native Mexican accent.

A lot of the imagery that’s been produced for software developers intentionally or inadvertently reinforces this vibe - the notion that the default developer is a white male, even when history and globalization show that that’s probably not the case. Yet because this is the view when women and other minorities join our ranks, they are given advice that encourages them to behave socially and linguistically like white men.

In this talk, I’ll explore how we can solve problems together as a diverse group, quite literally just by sharing space. I’ll discuss ways that we can be better allies to each other by fostering understanding, and highlight the positive impact of normalizing the appearance of minorities in the field.	Introductory and overview	Belasco (20)	10:30 - 11:30	Olivier De Meulder	Scrum, Sprint, Swarm	Like many software development teams, my team at The New York Times, uses scrum as our main process. To plan our sprints, we would go through the backlog, pick stories and assign a story to each of our six engineers, who would then work hard to get their story done. Because of unforeseen roadblocks, the stories would often get pushed to the next sprint or we would work together on a story to finish it before the end of the sprint. The problem with this process was that by the time we realized we needed to work together, it was often too late in the sprint.
Recently, we started working together, or swarming, for our entire sprints and only taking on a small number of stories at a time. Swarming is not a new concept; Many agile teams often swarm on a story to finish it before moving on to a new story. We took the definition of swarming and made it or own: We don’t just swarm to finish what has already been started, we swarm as soon as we start something new. And we’ve become more productive and collaborative as a result.

In this talk you will learn DevOps is not a person, role, or team. It's what an entire organization does. It's like Agile evolved. It's never an easy road to CI/CD but you need to start somewhere. We will deep dive into what DevOps is, how you can architect your software for daily delivery and quality. We will discuss ideas and practices from other industry leaders on how they applied DevOps principles into their software. Finally give you tips on how to move your software team towards a DevOps mindset, no matter the organization.

With the power of knowledge, we can enable ourselves to provide the best experience to our fellow developers, and our stakeholders. One of the solutions that supplies this power is Application Insights. Application Insights is a service provided by Microsoft allowing you to monitor your application live, detect performance anomalies, and observe this data with powerful analytics. Together we will see how easy it is to add Application Insights to our applications, whether we have access to the code-base or not. Once instrumented, we will dive deeper into the capabilities of Application Insights and show how to leverage all the rich data collected from our application. Finally, as developers the last thing we want to do is troubleshoot an issue in Production, with everyone watching and the stakes are high. Watch as we monitor a live application that is throwing exceptions and how Application Insights can be used to help us solve the problem faster. When we are done, attendees will be empowered with the knowledge to leverage Application Insights to be more productive with their work.

A Deep Dive into API Testing	Whether you are a tester or a developer of HTTP API’s, chances are you are already using Postman to some degree. Chances are also that you are missing out on some of the advanced goodness. Using only features of the free version, this session introduces you to effective use of these features to save time, reduce errors and share your work.

You learn how to :

- unclutter your collections with environments
- create dynamic requests with the powerful scripting environment
- chain requests (never run a separate utility to generate auth tokens again!)
- data drive an entire suite of tests with just a few clicks.
- backup and share your work
- automate the whole shebang from the command line, optionally with reports
- much more...

Ditch the click/wait/verify/repeat cycle! Concepts presented here apply to API testing in general, whether you use another tool or test with code only. Save time and gain confidence in your software.		Broadway (30)	12:45 - 13:45	André Barnes	After you commit	With everything being automated and repeatable these days DevOps is becoming more and more of a necessity for the the everyday developer to be knowledgeable of.  These days everything is being automated and stuffed into a repository.  Come and explore building CI and CD pipelines in Azure DevOps with an emphasis on .NET core apps.  In this talk we will discuss CI CD and dive into building some pipelines that handle testing, database migrations and security within Azure.

Observability provides an answer to this question, and poses new ones we didn't know to ask. 

In this session we'll start with an instrumented application, complete with features and bugs. We'll take on the role of new users and new developers, working together to understand and improve the application using insights gained from tracing and other observability tools.

Come with any level of experience in observability, and walk away with an understanding of how these tools can be applied to frontend development problems.

For it to be successful you need to get people from interested to effective before they lose interest.  

Without effective onboarding built into your app users will not stick with it long enough to discover the great features you've built.  

In this talk we'll dig into what it takes to design and optimize an effective onboarding process and equip you with a strategy for making incremental investments that can be fit into your development project.
